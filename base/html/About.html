        <p><i>“Will You Share Your Gender Swap Photos with Your Parents”</i><br>
            As a person who has a keen desire to build a society embracing gender minorities and gender diversity,
            this article posted by Vice caught my eye. <br>
            It talked about the untold number of Chinese users used VPN to gain access to the app
            and share their swapped faces on social networking platforms. <br>
            The journalist at Vice took photos for each interviewee with this filter,
            and probed into their attitudes toward homosexuality, feminism, cross-dressing,
            personal perception of their own sexuality and gender. <br>
            It is exciting to see younger generations are more receptive towards homosexuality and cross-dressing.<br>

            This Snapchat filter shed light on my understanding about
            what technologies could do to change our values, conventions, social norms, and eventually, our society.<br>
            And I saw the possibility of pursuing my aspirations in solving social issues through technology.<br>
            And by levering this powerful tool, my efforts could probably yield substantial results.<br>

            My technical recruiter work provides me a lens to see what are the most popular technologies in the IT industry,
            and it also allows me to understand their usage and functions.<br> The increasingly thick atmosphere of
            innovation in the IT industry in Seattle and daily access to avant-garde technologies
            helped me cultivated an interest in the IT industry.<br>
            I started self-learning via Coursera, and took the Probability and Statistics course offered online
            by Stanford University.<br> After enrolled in BU MET CS MSSD, I had in-depth study about software development
            and is expecting to graduate in this winter semester.
